## Overview
This is an example of server-side rendering using react, redux, and express.

### Components
- RequireAuth HOC, Header, Footer

### Page Components
- Admin List, Home, Not Found, User List

### Notes
- It's currently hard-coded to run on port 3000, find within server/index.js
- It's meant to work with the API located at http://react-ssr-api.herokuapp.com
- Yeah, it's a bit rough around the edges
